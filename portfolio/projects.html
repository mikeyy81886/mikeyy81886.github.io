        <li><strong>1. NIL Case Study for Strategic Management of Sport Organizations ---- For this case study, I discussed what NIL is, and how to improve it. I 
        I looked at three main issues: Restrictions and Regulations, Equity, and competitive imbalence
        Next I came up with solutions to these issues. I had to research what exactly has gone wrong, and come
        up with realistic ways the NCAA may resolve these problems. While I to not intend on working in college athletics, this project was worth while because
        it helped me understand imporant issues in the industry. NIL will also have a huge impact on proffessional sports, as more and more athletes will stay in school
        longer due to the money they can make through NIL. 
    </strong></li>
    <li><strong>2. Miami Marlins Case Study for Organization Behavior of Sport Organization ---- This was a very interesting project I worked on last year. I along with three classmates
        broke down what has gone wrong with the Miami Marlins managment, and why this might be. In 2020, they hired the first female General Manager in the big 4 American Sports, but within three
        years she stepped down. Their CEO, Derek Jeter had also just left the organization. As a group we looked in to posible causes of this, while also working on a solution to fix it.
        To us, there is a clear issue from the top of managment, which is why we think it is best for the Marlins to completley change their sturcture. We created a new Managment tree, so everyone knows
        who is in charge. With this system in place no one should feel undercut, and everyone will be on the same page. 
    <li><strong>3. Nike Organization Profile</strong></li>
    <li><strong>4.Organizational Observation for Strategic Management of Sport Organizations ---- This was my most recent project. I was assigned to attend a sporting event and grade the organization on eveyrhtng they do. 
        we where instructed to use AI to come up with a checklist to bring to the game. I attended an HPU basketball game and assesed that they do well, and what they do not do well. I then graded them in certain categories
        and came up with ways for them to imporve the overall experience.
