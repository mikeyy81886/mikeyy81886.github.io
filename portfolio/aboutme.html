   <p> Hello, my name is Mikey Youngman, and I am a senior at High Point University. I am from Boonton Township, New Jersey. I am studying sports management and am looking forward to my future once I graduate in May.
    My passion for sports started at a very young age. I grew up playing many sports, including hockey, baseball, soccer, tennis, wrestling, and lacrosse. However, one always stood out to me.
    Hockey. My love for hockey started around the age of 9. My father always had on the New York Rangers's games, but it took me a while to gain an interest. Once it did click, hockey was my life.
    I was all I watched and talked about. Soon after, I asked my parents if I could play. I spent the next few months learning how to skate and started playing at 10 years old. I had dreams of playing
    professional hockey and would have done anything to make it happen. Unfortunately, by my junior year of high school, I had already suffered seven concussions. At this time I realized I had to stop playing and focus.
    on my future. I then shifted my focus to the business side of sports. When applying to colleges, I looked into being a sports management major and what schools had the best programs. Seeing the connections I would have
    Here at HPU, it made my decision easy. Since being here, my knowledge of the sports industry has grown exponentially. In my freshman year, I started by taking an Intro to Sport Management as well as joining the Sport Management Association.
    By doing this, I was able to get my first internship as a second-semester freshman. I interned with the High Point Rockers, a local Atlantic League baseball team. I worked in fan experience but got an inside view of how a minor league
    baseball organization is run. Over the next few years, I took classes such as Sports Marketing, Sports Finance, Sport in Society, Organizational Behavior, and Strategic Management. By taking these classes, I was able to learn information and prepare
    to work in the industry. This past summer I was able to land a job working for the MLB Network. I recorded statistics, logged games, and controlled commercial breaks for MLB TV. I recently got a return offer for when I graduate in the spring.
    My journey in this industry started a long time ago and has a long time left. My experiences here at High Point University have helped get me where I am today. I am excited to continue my career and cannot wait for what is next.
    Although my childhood dream was to play professionally, working in sports would be amazing. I still hope to one day work in hockey. I would love to work in the front office of an NHL team, and it would become a full-circle moment,Â 
    if I could one day work for the New York Rangers. The team I grew up watching. The team that made me fall in love with sports. I am confident that I will make it happen one day and will do anything it takes to get it done.
